<h3>few norms you can follow</h3>
  <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>time complexity : </li>
        <li>space complexity : </li>
      </ul>
    <li>place your code in right directory</li>

  </ul>

<h4>you may add your solved questions on spoj codechef hackerearth hackerrank codeforces</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>first line of your code must begin with a comment mentioning the link of the question</li>
    <li>place the solutions in seperate folder "ques" in relevant directory</li>
  </ul>

    <li>you can mention the following thing in that</li>
      <ul>
        <li>description of your algorithm</li>
        <li>time and space complexity of your algorithm</li>
        <li>links to your fav online questions solvable by that algorithm</li>
          <ui>
            <li>you may also provide solution to that questions in "ques" folder in the same directory</li>
            <li>also mention link of solution(if there) along the question link</li>

<h4>Best Practice of creating a Pull Request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The PR name should be meaningful.</li>

  <li>There should be always 1 commit for 1 PR</li>
  <li>If there are more than 1 commit in a PR, squash them.</li>
  <li>Pull Request details should be descriptive.</li>
